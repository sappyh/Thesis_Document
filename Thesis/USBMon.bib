	abstract = {Software Defined Radio ({SDR}) may provide flexible, upgradeable and longer lifetime radio equipment for the military and for civilian wireless communications infrastructure. {SDR} may also provide more flexible and possibly cheaper multi-standard-terminals for end users. It is also important as a convenient base technology for the future context-sensitive, adaptive and learning radio units referred to as cognitive radios. {SDR} also poses many challenges, however, some of them causing {SDR} to evolve slower than otherwise anticipated. Transceiver development challenges include size, weight and power issues such as the required computing capacity, but also {SW} architectural challenges such as waveform application portability. {SDR} has demanding implications for regulators, security organizations and business developers.},
